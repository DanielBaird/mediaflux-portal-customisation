This repository and its related documentation website provides 
tools for customising a Mediaflux Portal.

If you're customising a portal you just need a single Sass file from this repository.
That file is here:

[Sass source file](styles/sass/styles.scss)

Follow the comments to edit it to suit you, and paste your edited copy here:

..to turn it into portal CSS.

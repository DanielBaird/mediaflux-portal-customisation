# Customising a MediaFlux portal

This work is a portion of the [RDS](http://www.rds.edu.au/)
funded A1.7 project and aimed to update the "Portal" 
functionality of the 
[Mediaflux](http://www.arcitecta.com/Products/Mediaflux) 
digital asset management system, to better encourage sharing 
of research data.


### Who is this for

This documentation and tool set is primarily aimed at Mediaflux
operators/administrators. Ideally you have some familiarity with 
CSS and XML -- or someone in your office does -- but we have
tried to make it easy to get everything working even if you 
don't know any CSS or XML.


### Getting started

So, you have a collection in Mediaflux and you want to share it
with the world. Portals are great for that! To make a collection
portal, you need to make two things:

* a portal configuration file, in XML format
* a portal CSS file, unsurprisingly in CSS format

This work will help you with both of those.


#### Producing custom CSS

We recommend going through the CSS customisation process 
carefully to produce a default layout and styling for your 
institution.  Each portal you produce after that can use your
default CSS with no additioonal effort, or spend time on
additional customisation.
